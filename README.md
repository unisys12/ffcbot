Discord Management Bot Project for Focused Fire Chat

Purpose
-------
Projects purpose is to create a Discord Management App/Bot for Focused Fire Chats Discord Server.

Utilization & Packages
----------------------
Project will utilize the following:

**Backend**
- NodeJS 
    - Discord.JS for Bot functions
    - MySQL for Database Queries and Connections

Project has advanced to a stage where, very quickly, I noticed that having the Bot and Website tied together was a really bad idea. This project is the bot side of the app, which runs on the Discord server. Currently, it's main job is logging chat message and placing certain message details into a database. 

######These are all very general ideas - call it a scratch-pad if you will. Updates will happen to this README as the project progresses.
